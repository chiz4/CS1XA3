# CS1XA3
Current version: Finished Part 1 and 6, can attatch every line with a "#TODO" and can remove all of the 
temporary files(*.tmp files). Tried to create an interactive program that uses conditional expressions that can 
determine which function is going to be run. Next,for part 1. Basically is just conditional expressions and a 
loop so that we can checkout every line and plug in a "#TODO". I checked stackoverflow to use others idea which 
could simplify the program.
For part 6 it is quite straightforward. We get every .tmp file and put it into a list, then delete it and the work is done.
